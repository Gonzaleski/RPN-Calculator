# Reversed Polish Notation Boolean Calculator

This repository contains a Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Boolean Calculator implemented in C using flex (lexical analyzer generator) and bison (parser generator).

## Usage

To run the project, you can either execute the provided executable file or follow these steps to compile it manually:

1. **Download the Files:**
   Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. **Compile the Code:**
   If you want to compile the code manually, follow these steps:

   ```bash
   # Step One: Generate the parser file
   bison -d boolcalc.y

   # Step Two: Generate the lexer file
   flex boolcalc.l

   # Step Three: Compile the parser and lexer files
   gcc boolcalc.tab.c lex.yy.c -o boolcalc
   ```

3. **Run the Program:**
   Once compiled, you can execute the program by running `./boolcalc` in your terminal.

## Accepted Inputs
   Accepted Inputs cover both capital and lower-case letters for true and false as well as 0 and 1.  
   
   Accepted symbols include & (for and), | (for or), and ! (for not).
   Examples of accepted inputs:
   ```
   TruE FAlsE & ! 0 |
   FaLSE true | 1 & ! FALSe |
   ```

## Outputs
   Outputs are only FALSE and TRUE in capital

## Files Included

- `boolcalc.l`: Lexical analyzer (flex) source file.
- `boolcalc.y`: Parser (bison) source file.
- `boolcalc.tab.h`: Header file generated by bison.
- `boolcalc.tab.c`: Parser file generated by bison.
- `lex.yy.c`: Lexical analyzer file generated by flex.
